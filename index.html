<li><h1 style="color:red;">Poetry</h1></li>
<p>I love to write poems to inspire people. I also write to calm my anxiety. I write a lot of them.</p>
<li><h1 style="color:red;">Coding</h1></li>
<p>I love to code in HTML. Coding is like a language I fluently speak. I want to keep making websites and maybe even get a career in coding.</p>
<li><h1 style="color:red;">Take pictures</h1></li>
<p>I like taking pictures of lightning, nature, and cemeteries. I like to take pictures because I feel like it captures the moment. I also use them and write poetry about them.</p>
